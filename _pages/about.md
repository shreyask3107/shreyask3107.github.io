I am a first-year **Computer Science** Masters student with a specialization in **Machine Learning** at **Columbia University** in the City of New York. Previously, I did my undergrad with honors at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Madras**. I am interested in the broad areas of **Machine Learning and Algorithms**. 

During my undergrad, I have published papers at International Conference on Machine Learning (**ICML 2022**), European Conference on Computer Vision (**ECCV 2022**), and IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (**IROS 2023**). I currently have 3 more papers under review in **eLife Sciences** Journal, **Nature Methods** Journal, and ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (**CHI 2024**). Wish me luck :).

I have worked with various teams during my undergrad. Particularly I am associated with **Microsoft Research India** (Summer 2023), **Jackson Laboratory** (Spring 2023), CDS **New York University** (Fall 2022), AirLab **Carnegie Mellon University** (Summer 2022), Computer Vision and Intelligence Club IIT Madras (Spring 2022), **Siemens Technology India** (Summer 2021) and **Vision and AI Lab**, Indian Institute of Science (Spring 2021).

I have also spent my Fall 2022 as an **Erasmus+** Exchange student at **Technical University of Denmark**, Copenhagen in their Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department.
