I am a senior undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am interested in the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Machine Learning models. 

I am currently working with [Prof. Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/), New York University on unsupervised metrics for unsupervised denoising. My Bachelor Thesis is supervised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Vivek Kumar](https://www.kumarlab.org/2018/03/21/vivek-kumar-phd/). In my thesis, I am focusing on unsupervised behavior identification of mouse in an open assay. In the summer of 2022, I worked at [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/), Carnegie Mellon University under [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) on neural radiance fields for 360 panorama settings. I interned for an year at [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html), Indian Institute of Science under the supervision of [Prof. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) where I worked on source free domain adaptation. 


I also have experience with industry research, having worked on reinforcement learning for sequential recommendation systems at Siemens Technology India. I was an active member of the Technical Clubs in my university where I have researched on binary segmentation of cracks. 


I have also spent a semester as an Erasmus+ Exchange student at Technical University of Denmark, where I learnt to adapt to different academic and research cultures.
