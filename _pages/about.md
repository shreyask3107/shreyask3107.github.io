I am a first-year **Computer Science** Masters student with a specialization in **Machine Learning** at **Columbia University** in the City of New York. I am currently advised by Prof. Smaranda Muresan at the Columbia NLP Lab. Previously, I did my undergrad with honors at the **Indian Institute of Technology, Madras** where I was advised by Prof. Balaraman Ravindran. 

I am interested in the broad areas of **Machine Learning and Algorithms**.

I have worked with various teams during my undergrad. Particularly I am associated with **Microsoft Research India**, **Jackson Laboratory**, and AirLab **Carnegie Mellon University**.

During my undergrad, I have published papers at International Conference on Machine Learning (**ICML 2022**), European Conference on Computer Vision (**ECCV 2022**), and IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (**IROS 2023**).

I have also spent my Fall 2022 as an **Erasmus+** Exchange student at **Technical University of Denmark**, Copenhagen in their Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Department.
