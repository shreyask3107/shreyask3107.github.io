I am a senior undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. I am interested in the theoretical foundations and practical applications of Machine Learning models. 

I am currently working with [Prof. Carlos Fernandez-Granda](https://cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/), Center for Data Science, New York University on unsupervised metrics for unsupervised denoising. My Bachelor Thesis is under [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Dr. Vivek Kumar](https://www.kumarlab.org/2018/03/21/vivek-kumar-phd/). I am working on Unsupervised Behavior identification of mouse in an open assay. In Summer 2022, I worked at [AirLab](https://theairlab.org/), Carnegie Mellon University under [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) on Neural Radiance Fields for 360 Panorama settings. During my Junior Year, I interned at [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/index.html), Indian Institute of Science under [Prof. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) where my work was on source free domain adaptation.
